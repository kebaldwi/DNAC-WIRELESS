# Dynamic Automation

## Overview
This Lab is designed to be used as a stand alone lab due. It has been created to address how to combine and use **IBNS 2.0** using **closed mode** and multiple Regular Templates within DNA Center to onboard network devices at Day 1 through N. This allows Network Administrators the ability to configure network devices in an ongoing and programmatic manner from within DNA Center without using the SD-Access Fabric methodology. It also enables an administrator to drag Regular Templates into and out of the flow as needed for ongoing maintenance.

This section will go through the flow involved in creating a deployable Composite Template from an IOS configuration script for a Catalyst switch linking it to a Switch profile, and deploying it through DNAC using provisioning workflows.

## General Information
As previously discussed, DNA Center can be used for Plug-and-Play and Day N or Ongoing Templates. Customers will start by building out an Onboarding Template which typically deploys only enough information to bring the device up initially. While it might include the entire configuration for a traditional network device, this is better served by Day N Templates and, for more flexibility Composite Templates. They can apply ongoing changes and allow device modifications after initial deployment. This lab section will focus on Day N templates built as regular templates within the DNA Center.

Another important consideration is that part of a typical configuration would include some lines of code, which will be built out with the *Design >Network Settings >* application within DNA Center. If the Design component is used, you should **not** deploy the same feature from cli code in a template to configure the device. It's a decision you have to make upfront, avoids a lot of lines in the templates, and allows for a more UI-centric configuration that is easier to maintain. 

As guidance, try and use **Design Settings** for as many of the configurations as you can, leaving Templates light and nimble for configurations that might change ongoing.

## Autoconf & IBNS 2.0 Secure Access
At the outset **IBNS 2.0** using **closed mode** can be modified effectively with the **Authentication Template Timers** deployed correctly on a switch, and while that will address some issues, sometimes a client will behave better with a **low impact mode** type of **access-session**. It is important to understand a few things:

1. You *cannot change* from **closed-mode** to **low-impact mode** *during a 802.1x session* as it will restart
2. That **closed mode** allows *no traffic* on the network from the host and so *DHCP will fail until authorized*
3. **Low impact mode** should be *protected* with a **pre-AUTH ACL** which is *overriden post authorization*
4. *Dynamically* interface templates can be deployed within **CoA**

Previously within the Composite Templating Lab and in the previous section, we introduced a methodology of automatically configuring the interfaces within the switch. This configuration relies on a few variables used to extrapolate the settings that were then configured via the template. This allowed a set of macros to be utilized to build out the various settings for VLANs, Ports, and Uplinks. 

While these were methodologies that dealt programmatically with port configuration, and while you may adapt them for an environment, they are both lacking in the fact that they are not dynamic enough. Again, it's impossible to determine without looking at the configuration where something is plugged in. Secondly, if equipment or users are plugged into the wrong interface, they may get the wrong level of access. 

In previous code revisions, we could deal with some of the problems with Auto Smart Port technology and IBNS 1.0, but that has been deprecated, and its replacement is a lot more dynamic. This section will deal with the first part of the problem concerning assigning ports for hardware like Access Points.

**Autoconf** is a solution that can be used to manage port configurations for data or voice VLAN, quality of service (QoS) parameters, storm control, and MAC-based port security on end devices that are deployed in the access layer of a network. Device classification is enabled when you enable the **Autoconf** feature using the `autoconf enable` command in global configuration mode. The onboard device classifier acts as an event trigger, which applies the appropriate automatic template to the interface. The default Autoconf service policy is applied to all the interfaces when the Autoconf feature is enabled using the `autoconf enable` command. For more information about **[Autoconf](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/switches/lan/catalyst9400/software/release/16-12/configuration_guide/nmgmt/b_1612_nmgmt_9400_cg/configuring_autoconf.pdf)** or alternatively **[Autoconf Documentation](./configuring_autoconf.pdf)**

It is also essential to understand that with **IBNS2.0** and templates or interfaces running in **closed mode**, the dynamic capability of **Autoconf** is not going to operate because there is a **service-policy** applied to the interface. While the device classifier will operate, for some devices that require an IP address, they may reboot before the classifier has done its job and so inconsistancies can occur. Remember in closed mode no packets are forwarded including DHCP prior to authentication occurring. If the interface is in **low impact mode**, then and only then will **Autoconf** operate properly and as a result of the **pre-AUTH ACL** DHCP may be allowed.

While **Autoconf** is a tremendous step forward for **non closed mode** ports, it will not function where **closed mode** has been applied at the moment. We need a way to *bridge* the gap so that we can dynamically assign a **low impact mode** configuration should the need arise. Luckily, we can use **EEM Event Manager** to solve the problem.

Luckily we can create a fully dynamic environment with a gated procedure. We include EEM scripts to give that Dynamic look and feel in this Lab entirely. Typically, the types of devices where we might have issues like this where *MAB* or *EAP* are not going to work fast enough, maybe those which identify themselves in another way. In those instances, we can use **PoE** power events to trigger an EEM. Likewise, on a port down event, we can revert the configuration. Those aspects are built into this Lab.

# Lab Preparation
## Lab Section 1 - DNA Center and ISE Integration
In this lab our focus changes slightly as we start to automate for host onboarding. A large component of host onboarding is the authentication of hosts and assignment within the network. In this section and in preparation for the steps which follow we will integrate DNA Center with Identity Services Engine. This integration allows pxGrid communication between the two and allows for automation of configuration within ISE for Network Access Devices, SGT, SGACL, and Policys.

### Step 1 - ***Prepare ISE for DNA Center Integration***
1. Open a web browser on the Windows Workstation Jump host. Open a connection to Identity Services Engine (ISE) and select the hamburger menu icon to open the system menu.

![json](./images/dnac-system-settings-aaa-ise-complete.png?raw=true "Import JSON")

## Lab Section 2 - DNA Center Design Preparation
While we could deploy more extensive settings for deployment, we will limit the configuration to the minimum necessary to perform this step, building off the completed tasks in labs one, [PnP Preparation](https://github.com/kebaldwi/DNAC-TEMPLATES/blob/master/LABS/LAB1-PNP-PREP/) and two, [Onboarding Templates](https://github.com/kebaldwi/DNAC-TEMPLATES/blob/master/LABS/LAB2-Onboarding-Template/).

Should you desire to deploy rapidly and build the lab faster then use the following approach:

### Step 1 - ***Import Postman Collection***
1. Download and import the collection within the ***Postman*** using the <a href="https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/kebaldwi/DNAC-TEMPLATES/blob/master/LABS/LAB8-Dynamic-Automation/postman/DCLOUD_DNACTemplatesLab_Workflow.postman_collection.json">⬇︎DCLOUD_DNACTemplateLab_Workflow.postman_collection.json⬇︎</a> file.
2. Extract the file to the desktop using **Winrar** to expand them
3. Open the **postman** application from the desktop. Once the application is open select *Collections* then click the *Import* link. 
![json](./images/Postman-Pre-Collection-Import.png?raw=true "Import JSON")
4. A window should appear on the file upload page. Click the upload button and select desktop from the windows explorer. Select the file named `DCLOUD_DNACTemplatesLab_Workflow.postman_collection.json` and click open. 
![json](./images/Postman-Collection-Select.png?raw=true "Import JSON")

![json](./images/Postman-SSL-Deselect.png?raw=true "Import JSON")
2. With these steps completed we are prepared to start the walk through of the sections below.

### Step 4 - ***Run the Collection within Postman***
This collection is built with a flow and delay timers wait for the collection to finish entirely.
1. If not open, open the **postman** application from the desktop. Once the application is open select *Collections* and then the '...' link and select **run collection**. </br>
![json](./images/Postman-CollectionRunner.png?raw=true "Import JSON")
2. On the right ensure all API are selected and click run collection. 
![json](./images/Postman-CollectionRunner-Run.png?raw=true "Import JSON")
3. After the entire collection has run you will see all of them listed on the left as shown, and two buttons on the top right, one for results and the other to run again.
![json](./images/Postman-CollectionRunner-Results.png?raw=true "Import JSON")
4. Within DNA Center you should see 3 devices within the inventory and additionally you should observe a complete hierarchy as well as settings and telemetry configured. The Devices will be discovered in the Building level at this stage.
![json](./images/Postman-Discovery.png?raw=true "Import JSON")
![json](./images/Postman-Settings.png?raw=true "Import JSON")

## Lab Section 3 - DNA Center Template Preparation
We will now import the various templates for use in this lab. Three will be utilized:

1. Onboarding Template
2. Lab Preparation Project & Templates
3. Dynamic DayN Composite Project & Templates

### Step 1 - ***Import Onboarding Template***
The Onboarding Template previously discussed in Lab 2 will be used to Plug and Play a switch within the environment. for more information on this please see [Onboarding Templates](https://github.com/kebaldwi/DNAC-TEMPLATES/blob/master/LABS/LAB2-Onboarding-Template/)

6. Once the project is imported, select it to view each of the template files within it.
   ![json](./images/DNAC-Template-Dynamic-files.png?raw=true "Import JSON")

Take a few moments and examine the construction of these projects and templates, as each has a specific function. Their design is modular to allow reuse of them within other composite templates for other switches or routers. 

## Lab Section 4 - DHCP & DNS Service Preparation
In this section we will prepare Domain Name System (DNS) and Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) on the Windows Server for the lab environment. The reasons for the configurations made here are detailed heavily in Lab 2 titled [Onboarding Templates](https://github.com/kebaldwi/DNAC-TEMPLATES/blob/master/LABS/LAB2-Onboarding-Template/)

### Step 1 - ***Configuring DHCP and DNS via Powershell***
1. Download the powershell script to the ***windows server*** using the <a href="https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/kebaldwi/DNAC-TEMPLATES/blob/master/LABS/LAB8-Dynamic-Automation/scripts/powershell.ps1">⬇︎powershell.ps1⬇︎</a> file.
2. Once downloaded, extract the file.
   ![json](./images/Powershell-Extract.png?raw=true "Import JSON")
   ![json](./images/Powershell-Extract-Location.png?raw=true "Import JSON")
3. Right click on the file and run with powershell.
   ![json](./images/Powershell-Run.png?raw=true "Import JSON")
4. You may see a security warning. If you do accept it by entering **Y**.
   ![json](./images/Powershell-Security.png?raw=true "Import JSON")
At this point all the DNS and DHCP configuration on the ***windows server*** will be generated.
   ![json](./images/DNS-DHCP.png?raw=true "Import JSON")

## Lab Section 5 - Image Repository
As we have discovered the devices, from the network, DNA Center has the capability to pull those images deployed from the network devices in bundle mode. If the device is in install mode then you would manually have to add the images. We can then mark them as **Golden** for *Plug and Play* and *image upgrade* purposes. 

For our purposes as we will be focusing on only the **9300-2** switch we will complete the following steps.

The image used in this lab for the 9300-2 is downloadable from here [⬇︎Bengaluru-17.06.01 MD⬇︎](https://software.cisco.com/download/home/286315874/type/282046477/release/Bengaluru-17.6.1) **(required)** 

1. Within DNA Center Navigate to *Design>Image Repository*  
   ![json](./images/DNAC-Design-ImageRepo-menu.png?raw=true "Import JSON")
2.  **Image Repository** should be populated with the image of the network device you wish to deploy. You can import the image using the **+ Import** link which will open a popup allowing you to choose a file from the local file system, or allow you to reference a URL for either HTTP or FTP transfer. 
   ![json](./images/DNAC-Design-ImageRepo-import.png?raw=true "Import JSON")
3. We will select the file from our local system.
   ![json](./images/DNAC-Design-ImageRepo-select.png?raw=true "Import JSON")
3. The file will then import into DNA Center.    
   ![json](./images/DNAC-Design-ImageRepo-imageimport.png?raw=true "Import JSON")
4. Once the file is imported and as the devices were previously discovered and assigned to the infrastructure we will navigate to the *Floor 1* in the hierarchy and mark the *17.06.01* as **Golden** as shown for PnP to use it.  
   ![json](./images/DNAC-Design-ImageRepo-golden.png?raw=true "Import JSON")

## Lab Section 6 - Setup of Discovered Devices
At this point in the lab the setup steps for the lab environment are done, DNS and DHCP are set up, ISE is integrated and DNA Center is ready for deploying configurations. In this section we will deploy the templates to configure the discovered devices. Note we could have automated this process too but wanted to separate this out so you can make modifications as you might need to for testing purposes.

### Lab SubSection 6.1 - 9300 Target Preparation
In this subsection we will prepare the **Target** using the *c9300-2.dcloud.cisco.com*. To begin preparation of this **Target** device we can deploy a template to modify discovered device within the infrastructure to reset it automatically. In order to accomplish this we will need to complete the following stages.

#### Step 1 - ***Building Switching Network Profiles***
1. Navigate to the **Design** within DNA Center through the menu *Design>Network Profile*.
   ![json](./images/DNAC-NetworkProfile-menu.png?raw=true "Import JSON")

      2. Select the dropdown **Template** tand search for *C9300-TARGET-Prep*.
      3. Click the **Tags** 
      4. Enter *RELOAD* as a tag. *(If necessary click the small* ***x** by any other tag visible)*
      5. Click **Add** 
         ![json](./images/DNAC-Profile-Target-add.png?raw=true "Import JSON")
5. Click **View** to ensure the RELOAD tag is the only tag applied and click **Save**.
   ![json](./images/DNAC-Profile-Target-save.png?raw=true "Import JSON")

#### Step 2 - ***Assigning Switching Network Profile to a Site***
1. **Assign** the network profile to the hierarchy 
![json](./images/DNAC-NetworkProfile-Switching-DayN-Assign.png?raw=true "Import JSON")
2. Select the **sites** to apply the profile within the hierarchy and click **Save**
![json](./images/DNAC-NetworkProfile-Switching-DayN-Assign-Site.png?raw=true "Import JSON")

#### Step 3 - ***Provisioning Target 9300 Switch***
We will now provision the **Target** switch using the *C9300-TARGET-Prep* DayN Template. The template uses a *Tag* of **RELOAD** so we need to first set that and then provision the switch. To do this, do the following:

##### Tag Switch
   1. Within DNA Center Navigate to *Provision>Inventory*.      
      ![json](./images/DNAC-InventoryProvision-menu.png?raw=true "Import JSON")
   2. Put a **checkmark** next to the device *c9300-1.dcloud.cisco.com*.
   3. Click the **Tag Device** link 
   4. Search for and place a **checkmark** beside *RELOAD*
   5. Click **Apply**    
      ![json](./images/DNAC-Provision-Target-tag.png?raw=true "Import JSON")

##### Provision Switch
   1. Within DNA Center Navigate to *Provision>Inventory*.      
      ![json](./images/DNAC-InventoryProvision-menu.png?raw=true "Import JSON")
   2. Put a checkmark next to the device *c9300-1.dcloud.cisco.com* to be provisioned.
   3. Click **Actions>Provision>Provision Device** link and walk through the workflow    
      ![json](./images/DNAC-Provision-Target-flow.png?raw=true "Import JSON")
   4. The floor was already selected during the **API Discovery** so click **next**    
      ![json](./images/DNAC-Provision-Target-flow-1.png?raw=true "Import JSON")
   5. Select *c9300-1.dcloud.cisco.com* on the left and the two tick boxes at the top of the page, then click **next**. If the template had inputs, they would be entered.
      ![json](./images/DNAC-Provision-Target-flow-2.png?raw=true "Import JSON")
   6. Check the settings and if you agree accept these settings by clicking  **Deploy**.
      ![json](./images/DNAC-Provision-Target-flow-3.png?raw=true "Import JSON")
   7. Three options are displayed. Choose to deploy **Now** and **Apply**
      ![json](./images/DNAC-Provision-Target-flow-4.png?raw=true "Import JSON")
   8. The task will be submitted, and the deployment will run.
   9. After a small amount of time, you will see a success notification. What is essential to understand is that the configuration, while pushed to the device, will resync in DNA Center after the resync timer has elapsed.        
      ![json](./images/DNAC-Provision-Target-success.png?raw=true "Import JSON")

#### Step 4 - ***Deleting the Target 9300 Switch***
We will now delete the **Target** switch to allow for the switch to be discovered automatically during the **Plug and Play (PnP)** process. In order to accomplish this complete the following tasks:
   1. Within DNA Center Navigate to *Provision>Inventory*.      
      ![json](./images/DNAC-InventoryProvision-menu.png?raw=true "Import JSON")
   2. Put a **checkmark** next to the device *c9300-1.dcloud.cisco.com*.
   3. Click **Actions>Inventory>Delete Device** link 
      ![json](./images/DNAC-Provision-Target-delete-1.png?raw=true "Import JSON")
   4. On the *Popup* that appears click **Ok**
      ![json](./images/DNAC-Provision-Target-delete-2.png?raw=true "Import JSON")
   5. DNA Center will then delete the switch from the Database.  
      ![json](./images/DNAC-Provision-Target-delete-3.png?raw=true "Import JSON")

### Lab SubSection 6.2 - ISR Preparation
In this subsection we will apply a small template to the ISR 4331. This is to prove out that we can deploy templates to modify discovered devices within the infrastructure no matter what variant they are. You could also use this method to apply configuration to a router to mitigate vulnerabilities discovered as part of a tennable security scan. 

#### Step 1 - ***Building Routing Network Profiles***
1. Navigate to the **Design** within DNA Center through the menu *Design>Network Profile*.
   ![json](./images/DNAC-NetworkProfile-menu.png?raw=true "Import JSON")
2. Select *Routing* under **Add Profile** .
   ![json](./images/DNAC-NetworkProfile-Routing-Add.png?raw=true "Import JSON")
3. Enter the following: 
      1. Enter the *Profile name* 
      2. Select *Zero* for **Service Providers**
      3. Click the **Device Type** dropdown and select *Cisco 4331 Integrated Services Router* 
      4. Click *Next* to proceed to the next step.

Congratulations you have set up ISE to perform the required Authentication and Authorization of the Access Point.

## Summary
Congratulations, at this point, you have successfully reviewed and setup the infrastructure equipment. The Composite template used will allow for *Low Impact* mode to be used on ports selectively where PoE devices power up.

During your review of the configurations used in this lab, please review the distribution switch which should have onboarded a Wireless Access Point using **Autoconf**. Then compare that to the switch running 802.1x IBNS 2.0 namely the Access Switch. On the Access Switch we utilize closed mode by default. We automatically modify the config on the port using PoE to put the device into **Low Impact** mode using an **EEM Script** specifically to deal with devices which might need either altered Service Policy for Authentication for instance MAB first vs 802.1x or low impact mode for autoconf. The point is understanding the gated method allows you to modify behaviour no matter what the cause.

### Use cases:
1. Modify policy priority on Auth Failure events Switch side
2. Modify policy to low impact mode
3. Revert the port to Closed Mode
