# Application Policys

## Overview
This Lab is designed to be used after first completing labs 1 through 4 and has been created to address how to properly deal with Quality of Service with regard to DNA Center. During the lab we will use Application Policies and apply Quality of Service (QoS) within DNA Center. We will also discuss, set up and use Controller Based Application Recognition. This allows Network Administrators the ability to configure network devices in an ongoing and programmatic manner from within DNA Center to make sure application policies are consistent throughout networks whether using SD-Access or Legacy Network Concepts. This set of concepts requires ***Advantage Licensing***.

## General Information
There are a number of hurdles to applying Quality of Service. If we were to read and study the Quality of Service whitepaper we would still have hours of work to determine the correct MQC policies to be deployed for the various linecards and chassis within our network. DNA Center allows us to do three things:
1. Update all protocol packs and dynamic URL's used for Application Discovery.
2. Deploy a consistent end-to-end QoS policy.
3. Monitor application usage to assure application and user satisfaction
In order to accomplish this we will discuss all the relevant aspects of these goals along with how we accomplish them in this lab.

## Lab Section 1 - Controller Based Application Recognition
The Application Visibility service lets you manage your built-in and custom applications and application sets. The Application Visibility service, hosted as an application stack within Cisco DNA Center, lets you enable the **C**ontroller-**B**ased **A**pplication **R**ecognition (CBAR) function on a specific device to classify thousands of network and home-grown applications and network traffic. This allows us to deal with applications beyond the capabilities of NBAR 2 which is some 1400 applications currently.

The following packages must be installed and are in the dCLOUD environment:
1. *Application Policy*: Lets you automate QOS policies across LAN, WAN, and wireless within your campus and branch.
2. *Application Registry*: Lets you view, manage, and create applications and application sets.
3. *Application Visibility Service*: Provides application classification using Network-Based Application Recognition (NBAR) and CBAR techniques.

The Day-N Application Visibility page provides a quick view of application registry, device recognition method, device CBAR readiness, application observed in the network for the past 2, 24, or 48 hours, and CBAR health.

The Application Visibility service lets Cisco DNA Center connect with external authoritative sources like Cisco's NBAR Cloud, Infoblox or the Microsoft Office 365 Cloud Connector to help classify the unclassified traffic or help generate improved signatures. Through CBAR we can discover applications from sources such as Cisco's NBAR Cloud, Infoblox, or Microsofts 0365 and catagorize them for use on our network. Additionally, unclassified traffic can come from any flow that the CBAR-enabled device identifies but that is not recognized by the NBAR engine. In such cases, the applications that have a meaningful bit rate are reported as unclassified and can be imported and used as applications within application sets within Cisco DNA Center.

As the number of applications is always changing and protocol packs are always being updated we can keep those current on the network through CBAR as well. Visibility sometimes can be lost from end-to-end with outdated protocol packs whcih do not allow some application to be correctly recognized which can cause not only visibility holes within the network but also incorrect queuing or forwarding issues. CBAR solves that issue by allowing the push of updated protocl packs across the network.

   ![json](./images/DNAC-AppPolicy-6-QueueCVD.png?raw=true "Import JSON")
9. Within the Queuing Profile Editor you would name the new profile and then adjust the sliders to set your queuing policy. Once complete you would click **Select** to use that policy. We will not deviate from the CVD standard at this time so click **Cancel**.
   ![json](./images/DNAC-AppPolicy-7-QueueCustom.png?raw=true "Import JSON")
   #### Host Tracking
10. Click the **Host Tracking Slider** to allow for QoS policy to work with endpoint mobility. When host tracking is turned on, Cisco DNA Center tracks the connectivity of the collaboration endpoints within the site scope and automatically reconfigures the ACL entries when the collaboration endpoints connect to the network or move from one interface to another. 
   ![json](./images/DNAC-AppPolicy-8-Tracking.png?raw=true "Import JSON")
   #### Saving Draft Policy
11. At this point we could save a copy of the Application Policy by selecting the three dots beside Deploy a pop up menu will appear.

## Automating Application Policies
While it is possible to click through these processes manually, which can be time-consuming, we can handle this differently. We may automate them further via REST API.

## Summary
The next step will be to build Enable Telemetry in the network infrastructure.
