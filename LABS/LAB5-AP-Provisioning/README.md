# Composite Templates 
## Overview
This Lab is designed to be used after first completing labs 1 through 3 and has been created to address how to combine and use multiple Regular Templates within DNA Center to onboard network devices at Day 1 through N. This allows Network Administrators the ability to configure network devices in an ongoing and programmatic manner from within DNA Center without using the SD-Access Fabric methodology. It also allows an Administrator the ability to drag Regular Templates into and out of the flow as needed for ongoing maintenance.

This section will go through the flow involved in creating a deployable Composite Template from an IOS configuration script for a Catalyst switch linking it to a Switch profile and deploy it through DNAC using provisioning workflows.

## General Information
As previously discussed, DNA Center can be used for not only Plug and Play but also Day N or Ongoing Templates customers will start by building out an Onboarding Template which typically deploys only enough information to bring the device up initially. While it might include the entire configuration for a traditional network device, this is better served by Day N Templates and for more flexibility Composite Templates. as they can be used to apply ongoing changes and to allow device modifications after initial deployment. This lab section will focus on Day N templates to be built as regular templates within DNA Center.

Another important consideration is that part of a typical configuration would include some lines of code which will be built out with the *Design >Network Settings >* application within DNA Center. If the Design component is used you should **not** deploy the same feature from cli code in a template to configure the device. Its a decision you have to make upfront and avoids a lot of lines in the templates and allows for a more UI centric configuration which is easier to maintain. 

As a guidance try and use **Design Settings** for as much of the configurations as you can leaving Templates light and nimble for configurations which might change ongoing.

## Lab Section 1 - DNA Center Design Preparation
While we could deploy more extensive settings for deployment, we will limit the configuration to the minimum necessary to perform this step, building off the completed tasks in lab 2.

## Lab Section 2 - DNA Center Day N Composite Template Preparation
You can create Day N Composite Templates within the ***Template Editor*** within **DNA Center**. Go to the ***Template Editor*** to complete the next task. In this lab, we will deploy a Composite Template and additional Regular Templates within a project.  The import and export function within **DNA Center** allows both the import and export of templates and projects, along with the ability to clone them.

### Step 1 - ***Import Project with Templates***
Download and import the project within the ***Template Editor*** using the <a href="https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/kebaldwi/DNAC-TEMPLATES/blob/master/LABS/LAB4-Composite-Template/templates/2125templates/DNAC_Template_Lab_DayN_project.json">⬇︎DNAC_Template_Lab_DayN_project.json⬇︎</a> file. If using DNAC prior release to 2.1.2.X then use the previously built project within Lab 3 and build the templates located within the following <a href="https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/kebaldwi/DNAC-TEMPLATES/blob/master/LABS/LAB4-Composite-Template/templates/Platinum_Templates.zip">⬇︎Platinum_Templates.zip⬇︎</a> file located within this lab. 

Previously in Lab 3, we created a project where we assigned a template to the site and provisioned it. We will now expand on that by importing a project with the same name overtop the current project, thereby importing additional regular templates. Take a few moments and examine the construction of these templates, as each has a specific form and function. Their design is modular to allow reuse of them within other composite templates for other switches or routers.

1. Navigate to the **Template Editor** within DNA Center through the menu *Tools>Template Editor*.
   ![json](./images/DNAC-NavigateTemplate.png?raw=true "Import JSON")
2. Within the **template editor**, left-click the ⨁ icon to the right of find template and click **Import Project(s)** within the menu.  
   ![json](./images/DNAC-ProjectImportBegin.png?raw=true "Import JSON")
3. Download the file above *DNAC_Template_Lab_DayN_project.json* to be imported into the DNA Center. Once downloaded, extract the file.
4. From the **Import Project(s)** window, click **Select a file from your computer** from the explorer window, select the extracted JSON file and click open. 
   ![json](./images/DNAC-ProjectSelect.png?raw=true "Import JSON")
5. Click **Import**, and the project and all the templates within it will be imported.   
   ![json](./images/DNAC-ProjectImport.png?raw=true "Import JSON")
6. Once the project is imported, select it to view each of the template files within it.
   ![json](./images/DNAC-ProjectFiles.png?raw=true "Import JSON")
 
The project we imported contains the following templates:
1. **AAA** for local AAA services
   ![json](./images/DNAC-Project-AAA-Template.png?raw=true "Import JSON")
2. **System Management** for global system settings
   ![json](./images/DNAC-Project-SysMgmt-Template.png?raw=true "Import JSON")
3. **VLANs Ports per DF** to add VLAN and port configuration
   ![json](./images/DNAC-Project-PortAssign-Template.png?raw=true "Import JSON")
4. **Local User Management** for additional user accounts
   ![json](./images/DNAC-Project-USR-Template.png?raw=true "Import JSON")
5. **Stacking** to set up powerstack and stack priority
   ![json](./images/DNAC-Project-Stacking-Template.png?raw=true "Import JSON")
6. **Access Lists** to restrict management access
   ![json](./images/DNAC-Project-ACL-Template.png?raw=true "Import JSON")
7. **Automatic Uplink Naming** to automatically name uplinks 
   ![json](./images/DNAC-Project-AUN-Template.png?raw=true "Import JSON")

Additionally, it contains a Composite Template. The composite template will allow us to reuse multiple Regular templates, thereby allowing modularity. Thus we can keep our configuration scripts in smaller files allowing reuse across various platforms. Subsequently helps in troubleshooting as the configurations become smaller and less complex as a result.

## Lab Section 2 - DNA Center Composite Template Preparation

### Step 1 - ***Create Composite Template***
Within the project is a Composite Template, but the steps involved to create one are simple. **The next steps are optional**.

1. Within the **template editor**, Hover over the right side of the project, and a small ⚙ gear icon will appear. Select **Add Template(s)** from the menu.     
   ![json](./images/DNAC-CompositeCreate.png?raw=true "Import JSON")
2. On the *Add New Template* sidebar:
   1. Select **Composite Sequence**
   2. Enter a **Name** for the Composite Template
   3. Click **Edit** beside *Device Types* to select the device families to be used.   
      ![json](./images/DNAC-CompositeDefine.png?raw=true "Import JSON")
3. On the *Select Device Types* sidebar type in `9300`to filter for the switch family and select the entire series then click **Back to Add New Template**.         
   ![json](./images/DNAC-CompositeDevices.png?raw=true "Import JSON")
4. Next Select the **Software Type** *IOS-XE* from the dropdown.    
   ![json](./images/DNAC-CompositeOS.png?raw=true "Import JSON")
5. Lastly complete the Add New Template sequence by clicking **Add**    
   ![json](./images/DNAC-CompositeAdd.png?raw=true "Import JSON")

As these steps have been completed already and a blank Composite Template exists we will now create the composite sequencing of the regular templates within the existing Composite Template.

### Step 2 - ***Sequencing the Composite Template***
Within the project is a Composite Template **DNAC Template Lab DayN Composite**. This is the template in which we will create a composite sequence or workflow to call modularized regular templates in order to configure the 9300 switch.

Please note the sequence that we want our templates in will be the following:    
![json](./images/DNAC-CompositeSequence.png?raw=true "Import JSON")

1. Within the **template editor**, select the template **DNAC Template Lab DayN Composite** from the right pane and it will open.       
   ![json](./images/DNAC-Composite-Begin.png?raw=true "Import JSON")
2. You will notice that beside all the templates which are able to be used within the composite template a small arrow icon is showing. This denotes that those templates are of the same device type and OS and are available to be dragged into the template.   
   ![json](./images/DNAC-Composite-Symbol.png?raw=true "Import JSON")
3. First Drag the **Access Lists** template from the left into the right pane and release it. It should appear in position 1.   
   ![json](./images/DNAC-Composite-ACL-Add.png?raw=true "Import JSON")
4. Next Drag the following into the right pane in this order:
   1. **AAA**
   2. **System Management**
   3. **Local User Management**
   4. **Stacking**
   5. **VLANs Ports per DF**
   6. **Automatic Uplink Naming**    
      ![json](./images/DNAC-Composite-Remain-Add.png?raw=true "Import JSON")
5. Finally we will reorder the sequence by moving the **AAA** template to position one in the sequence. To do this: 
   1. Hover over the left side of the **AAA** template and you will see a green bar. By clicking and grasping this tool you can drag the template to the appropriate spot in the sequence.   
      ![json](./images/DNAC-Composite-MoveBar.png?raw=true "Import JSON")
   2. With this method please move the **AAA** template to position one as shown.    
      ![json](./images/DNAC-Composite-DragAAA.png?raw=true "Import JSON")
   3. After moving the **AAA** template the sequence will look like this. 
      ![json](./images/DNAC-Composite-Sequence-Finish.png?raw=true "Import JSON")
6. Once the Template is properly sequenced save the template.    
   ![json](./images/DNAC-Composite-Save.png?raw=true "Import JSON")
7. Then commit the template for use.   
   ![json](./images/DNAC-Composite-Commit.png?raw=true "Import JSON")   
   ![json](./images/DNAC-Composite-Apply.png?raw=true "Import JSON")

### Step 3 - ***Modify Network Profile***
Next, we need to assign the DayN Composite Template to a site using the Network Profile. As there is an existing network profile for the site, we must reuse that one for the same device family. **(required)** 

   1. Navigate to Network Profiles by selecting *Design> Network Profiles*.
      ![json](./images/DNAC-NavigateProfile.png?raw=true "Import JSON")
   2. Click the **Edit** link next to the **DNAC Template Lab** switching profile created earlier.  
      ![json](./images/DNAC-ProfileEdit.png?raw=true "Import JSON")
   3. Within the Profile Editor, select the **Day-N Template(s)** tab:
      ![json](./images/DNAC-ProfileDayN.png?raw=true "Import JSON")
      1. Select the Composite Template by either searching or choosing *DNAC Template Lab DayN Composite* from the dropdown as shown.
         ![json](./images/DNAC-ProfileSelectComposite.png?raw=true "Import JSON")   
      4. Click **Save** to save the modifications to the Network Profile.
         ![json](./images/DNAC-ProfileSave.png?raw=true "Import JSON")   

Now the Composite Template has been applied to the Network Profile, any changes made to the template would immediately be ready for provisioning to the sites aligned to the profile where the template is deployed. This allows for ongoing changes and modifications to the network infrastructure.

## Lab Section 3 - Provisioning
At this point, DNAC is set up and ready to provision the new composite template to the device. This next set of sequences will push the various Network Settings, Services, and DayN Templates as part of the composite sequence to the device.

### Step 1 - ***Provisioning the Device***
We will now provision the switch using DayN Composite Templates. To do this, do the following:

   1. Within DNA Center Navigate to *Provision>Inventory*.      
   ![json](./images/DNAC-NavigateInventory.png?raw=true "Import JSON")
   2. Put a checkmark next to the device *ACCESS-c9300-1-ASW* to be provisioned.
   3. Click the **Actions>Provision>Provision Device** link and walk through the workflow    
   ![json](./images/DNAC-ProvisionBegin.png?raw=true "Import JSON")
      1. The floor was already selected as part of the claim so click **next**    
      ![json](./images/DNAC-ProvisionSite.png?raw=true "Import JSON")
      2. Select *ACCESS-c9300-1-ASW* on the left and the two tick boxes at the top of the page, then click **next**. If the template had inputs, they would be entered.  
      ![json](./images/DNAC-ProvisionAdvConfig.png?raw=true "Import JSON")
      3. Select the auto populated Serial Number using the dropdown under *Stacking*..
      ![json](./images/DNAC-ProvisionConfigSerial.png?raw=true "Import JSON")
      4. Select the auto populated Product ID from the dropdown under *VLANs Ports Per DF*.
      ![json](./images/DNAC-ProvisionConfigPID.png?raw=true "Import JSON")
      5. Ensure the MDF number *01* is entered under *VLANs Ports Per DF*.
      ![json](./images/DNAC-ProvisionConfigMDF.png?raw=true "Import JSON")
      6. Click anywhere in the white space of the page to accept these settings so a green tick appears and then click **Next**.
      ![json](./images/DNAC-ProvisionConfigReady.png?raw=true "Import JSON")
      7. Check the settings and if you agree accept these settings by clicking  **Deploy**.
      ![json](./images/DNAC-ProvisionDeploy.png?raw=true "Import JSON")
   4. The task will be submitted, and the deployment will run.
   5. After a small amount of time, you will see a success notification. What is essential to understand is that the configuration, while pushed to the device, will resync in DNA Center after the resync timer has elapsed.        
   6. To resync the configuration so that it may be viewed before the normal 25 mins, then perform the following task:
      1. Change the focus to **Inventory**
      2. Select the *ACCESS-c9300-1-ASW* switch and select **Actions>Inventory>Resync Device**
      ![json](./images/DNAC-InventoryResync.png?raw=true "Import JSON")
      3. After the resync has occurred, you may click the device name and then view the configuration by selecting that from the left pane to view the configuration pushed.
      ![json](./images/DNAC-DeviceConfig.png?raw=true "Import JSON")

At this point, we have onboarded a device and successfully pushed configuration via Onboarding and DayN Templates as well as Composite Templates. 

## Automating Composite Templates
While it is possible to click through these processes manually, which can be time-consuming, we can handle this differently. We may automate them further via REST API.

## Summary
The next step will be to build and deploy an Application (QoS) Policy in the network infrastructure.
