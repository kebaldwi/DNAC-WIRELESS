# Advanced Automation
## Overview
This Lab is designed to be used after first completing labs 1 through 4 and has been created to address how to use some advanced automation concepts not previously touched on in the previous labs. This is an enablement type lab and is designed to help customers to reach beyond what they currently understand and try new concepts and really push the boundaries of automation.

During this lab we will cover various topics with regard to template logic to solve various use cases. Some of these concepts have been previously covered but perhaps not with as indepth a focus.

The examples shown below can be used in building your own versions of the templates. The concept of this lab is for you to build regular templates that you can substitute into the composite to test with. Various methods for the varying use cases will be given explaining pros and cons along the way. Expand your capabilities with this lab and take your abilities to the next level. You're only inhibited by your own imagination. 

## General Information
As previously discussed, DNA Center can be used for not only Plug and Play but also Day N or Ongoing Templates. Customers will start by building out an Onboarding Template which typically deploys only enough information to bring the device up initially. While it might include the entire configuration for a traditional network device, this is better served by Day N Templates and for more flexibility Composite Templates. as they can be used to apply ongoing changes and to allow device modifications after initial deployment. 

Another important consideration is that part of a typical configuration would include some lines of code which will be built out with the *Design >Network Settings >* application within DNA Center. If the Design component is used you should **not** deploy the same feature from cli code in a template to configure the device. Its a decision you have to make upfront and avoids a lot of lines in the templates and allows for a more UI centric configuration which is easier to maintain. 

As a guidance try and use **Design Settings** for as much of the configurations as you can leaving Templates light and nimble for configurations which might change ongoing.

With these things in mind we will cover various aspects and use cases which perhaps allow for a more programamtic approach.

## Topics
The various topics covered in the lab will be the following:

1. *Self-deleting EEM scripts*
2. Working with *Arrays and Methods* in *Velocity*
3. Using *Conditional Statements* for Configuration
4. Velocity and *Enable* versus *Interactive* mode
5. Assigning port configuration in a stack
6. Autoconf vs Smartports
7. IBNS 2.0 configuration

## Use Cases
The Topics listed above will be covered in a number of use cases to show the capability and flexibility of the templating engine within DNA Center. While we will utilize Velocity language the same can be accomplished in the Jinja2 language.

## Step 1 - ***Renaming Interfaces - Use Case***
Previously within the Composite Templating Lab we introduced a methodology of automatically naming the interfaces within the switch. When a new device or switch/router/access point connects to a switch we want to name those interfaces. Naming the uplinks specifically, but also the various wireless access points and IP Phones would be a nice addition. 

### ***Examine Code***
The script which we used on the Composite Templates uses an EEM Script which runs whenever a CDP event occurs.

```
   event manager applet update-port
    event neighbor-discovery interface regexp GigabitEthernet.* cdp add
    action 101 regexp "(Switch|Router)" "$_nd_cdp_capabilities_string"
    action 102 if $_regexp_result eq "1"
    action 103  cli command "enable"
    action 104  cli command "config t"
    action 105  cli command "interface $_nd_local_intf_name"
    action 106  regexp "^([^\.]+)\." "$_nd_cdp_entry_name" match host
    action 107  regexp "^([^\.]+)" "$_nd_port_id" match connectedport
    action 108  cli command "no description"
    action 109  cli command "description Uplink to $host - $connectedport"
    action 110  cli command "interface port-channel 1"
    action 111  cli command "no description"
    action 112  cli command "description Uplink to $host"
    action 113  cli command "end"
    action 114  cli command "write"
    action 115 end
```

While this script will rename the uplinks connected to a Router or Switch it is limited in terms of the following:
1. Timing, as its not scheduled, and you cannot clear the CDP table from the template
2. Naming Access Points or other devices is also not taken into consideration

### ***Modify Code***
So lets modify the EEM script to first solve the naming aspect with regard to connected devices

```
   event manager applet update-port
    event neighbor-discovery interface regexp GigabitEthernet.* cdp add
    action 101 regexp "(Switch|Router)" "$_nd_cdp_capabilities_string"
    action 200 if $_regexp_result eq "1"
    action 201  regexp "(Trans-Bridge)" "$_nd_cdp_capabilities_string"
    action 210  if $_regexp_result eq "1"
    action 211   cli command "enable"
    action 212   cli command "config t"
    action 213   cli command "interface $_nd_local_intf_name"
    action 214   regexp "^([^\.]+)" "$_nd_cdp_entry_name" match host
    action 215   regexp "^([^\.]+)" "$_nd_port_id" match connectedport
    action 216   cli command "no description"
    action 217   cli command "description AP - $host - $connectedport"
    action 220  else
    action 221   cli command "enable"
    action 222   cli command "config t"
    action 223   cli command "interface $_nd_local_intf_name"
    action 224   regexp "^([^\.]+)\." "$_nd_cdp_entry_name" match host
    action 225   regexp "^([^\.]+)" "$_nd_port_id" match connectedport
    action 226   cli command "no description"
    action 227   cli command "description Link - $host - $connectedport"
    action 228   cli command "interface port-channel 1"
    action 229   cli command "no description"
    action 230   cli command "description Link - $host"
    action 240  end
    action 250 else
    action 251  regexp "(Phone)" "$_nd_cdp_capabilities_string"
    action 252  if $_regexp_result eq "1"
    action 253   cli command "enable"
    action 254   cli command "config t"
    action 255   cli command "interface $_nd_local_intf_name"
    action 256   regexp "^([^\.]+)" "$_nd_cdp_entry_name" match host
    action 257   regexp "^([^\.]+)" "$_nd_port_id" match connectedport
    action 258   cli command "no description"
    action 259   cli command "description Phone - $host - $connectedport"
    action 260  end
    action 270 end
    action 280 cli command "write"
```
First lets address the primary problem, the naming of interfaces with descriptions.

You will see that lines *201 to 220* were added to the EEM script. Within that construct we look for the keyword `Trans-Bridge` within the built in variable to determine if the port is connected to an Access Point. If it is then it results in a True or binary 1 state and the included code from lines *211 to 220* run line by line. The configuration adds a description to the interface for the phone of `description AP - KO-AP0C75 - GigabitEthernet0` for example.

You will see that lines *250 to 260* were added to the EEM script. Within that construct we look for the keyword `Phone` within the built in variable to determine if the port is connected to a Phone. If it is then it results in a True or binary 1 state and the included code from lines *253 to 260* run line by line. The configuration adds a description to the interface for the phone of `description Phone - SEPB07D47D34910 - Port 1` for example.

The second part of the problem within this use case is solving for the issue presented by a lack of functionality when the code is configured on the switch. While we can get the configuration in place it will only run when the port is cycled or when the CDP information for the port is cleared. To solve the problem we therefore employ a *Self-Destructing EEM script*.

*Self-Destructing EEM scripts* are those that delete themselves on termination. Within the code below you will notice that the line 2.1 removes the EEM applet from the configuration and then line 2.3 ensures the configuration is written to NVRAM prior to terminating.

```
   event manager applet POST_PNP
    event timer countdown time 30
    action 1.0 cli command "enable"
    action 1.1 cli command "clear cdp table"
    action 2.0 cli command "config t"
    action 2.1 cli command "no event manager applet POST_PNP"
    action 2.2 cli command "end"
    action 2.3 cli command "wr
    action 2.4 cli command "exit
```

This code allows us to *clear the cdp table* and delete itself but leave the other EEM script on the switch for any moves adds and changes to the devices connected to the switch.

## Step 2 - ***Building Stacks - Use Case***
Previously within the Composite Templating Lab we introduced a methodology of automatically build a data stack and power stack configuration within the switch. When a new device or switch is built we may want to control which switch is Active and which switch is standby within the stack. 

### ***Examine Code***
To that end the following configuration has been built previously:

```
   ## 9300 Stack Power and Priority
   ##Variables
   #set( $StackCount = $Serial.split(",") )
   #set( $StackMemberCount = $StackCount.size() )
   !
   ##Stacking Commands
   #if( $StackMemberCount > 1 )
      stack-power stack Powerstack1
      mode redundant strict
      #if( $StackMemberCount > 4 )
         stack-power stack Powerstack2
         mode redundant strict
      #end
      #foreach( $Switch in [1..$StackMemberCount] )
         #if( $Switch < 5 )
            stack-power switch ${Switch}
            stack Powerstack1
         #elseif( $Switch > 4 )
            stack-power switch ${Switch}
            stack Powerstack2
         #end
       #end
       #MODE_ENABLE
       #MODE_END_ENABLE
       #MODE_ENABLE
       #foreach( $Switch in [1..$StackMemberCount] )
          #if($Switch == 1)
             switch $Switch priority 10
          #elseif($Switch == 2)
             switch $Switch priority 9
          #else
             switch $Switch priority 8
          #end 
       #end
       #MODE_END_ENABLE
   #end
```
Within this script you can see the use of the Arrays `$Stackcount` which is formed through the use of the `.split(",")` method which takes the string returned from the database and splits the list into two elements within the Array `$Stackcount`. You could address each element in the Array remembering that Arrays always start the numbering of elements at position zero (0). In a two element Array you could call the data with these two options; for the first element in the Array `$Stackcount[0]` or for the second element in the Array `$Stackcount[1]`.

Within this script you can see the use of the Conditional Statements `#if #elseif #else #end` these are used to dynamically build configuration for switch stacks no matter how many switches are within the stack. For example if the number of switches in the stack is above 4 then it creates automatically 2 powerstack environments for power redundancy. The script also sets the priority of the Active and Standby switch above those of the rest of the switches in the stack.

Within this script you can see the use of the Enable Statements `#MODE_ENABLE #MODE_END_ENABLE` these commands allow for privileged level non configuration commands to be entered. In this script we need to configure the privileged level command to set switch priority for individual switches `switch $Switch priority #`. Bracketing this configuration command with the velocity statements `#MODE_ENABLE #MODE_END_ENABLE` allows for us to change from configuration mode to enable mode and back again.

## Step 3 - ***Assigning Port Configuration - Use Case***
Previously within the Composite Templating Lab we introduced a methodology of automatically configuring the interfaces within the switch. This configuration relied on a few variables which were use to extrapolate the settings which were then configured via the template. This allowed for a set of macros to be utilized to build out the various settings for VLANs, Ports and Uplinks. 

### ***Examine Code***
We will analyze the configuration in more detail below and modify it for greater capabilities toward the end of this section.

```
   ##Stack information variables
   #set( $StackPIDs = $ProductID.split(",") )
   #set( $StackMemberCount = $StackPIDs.size() )
   #set( $PortTotal = [] )
   #set( $offset = $StackMemberCount - 1 )
   #foreach( $Switch in [0..$offset] )
     #set( $Model = $StackPIDs[$Switch])
     #set( $PortCount = $Model.replaceAll("C9300L?-([2|4][4|8]).*","$1") )
     #set( $foo = $PortTotal.add($PortCount) )
   #end
```
Within the first block of code some interesting concepts are dealt with. First we create an *Array* with the various Product ID's for each switch within the stack using the `.split(",")` *method* as we previously discussed in step 2. The `.size()` *method* is then used to determine how many switches are in the stack. A blank *array* is defined for later use. We then create an offset variable to account for the fact that *arrays* start at zero (0) to be used throughout the template.

Within the loop structure, we iterate through using the variable PortCount to load the regex value grep'd from the Product ID accomplished via the `.replaceAll(""C9300L?-([2|4][4|8]).*","$1"")` *method* which in each case is either 24 or 48 to denote a 24 or 48 port switch. The PortCount variable is then appended to the *array* PortTotal using the add *method*.

We now have the data we need to configure the ports of the switch, being the number of switches, and the number of ports in each switch.
```
   !
   ## VLANs per MDF
   #set( $data_vlan_number = 200 + ${MDF} )
   #set( $voice_vlan_number = 300 + ${MDF} )
   #set( $ap_vlan_number = 400 + ${MDF} )
   #set( $guest_vlan_number = 500 + ${MDF} )
   #set( $bh_vlan_number = 999 )
   !
```
In the configuration above we use simple addition to determine the VLAN ID for each vlan built from a set of constants and a numeric variable to denote the MDF.
```
   !
   vlan ${data_vlan_number}
    name data
   vlan ${voice_vlan_number}
    name voice
   vlan ${ap_vlan_number}
    name accesspoint
   vlan ${guest_vlan_number}
    name guest
   vlan ${bh_vlan_number}
    name disabled
   !
   device-tracking upgrade-cli force
   !
   device-tracking policy IPDT_MAX_10
    limit address-count 10
    no protocol udp
    tracking enable
   !
   ##Macros
   ## Use Bind to Source variable to select access interfaces 
   #macro( access_interface )
     description Workstation
     switchport access vlan ${data_vlan_number}
     switchport mode access
     switchport voice vlan ${voice_vlan_number}
     switchport port-security maximum 3
     switchport port-security
     spanning-tree portfast
     spanning-tree bpduguard enable
   #end
```
Here we define a Macro to configure the various ports of the switch with a standard voice and data VLAN.
```
   !
   #macro( uplink_interface )
     switchport trunk allowed vlan add $data_vlan_number,$voice_vlan_number,$ap_vlan_number,$guest_vlan_number,$bh_vlan_number
   #end
```
Within the above code we define a Macro to add the various VLANs to the trunk interface via the Port-Channel.
```
   !
   ##Access Port Configuration
   #foreach( $Switch in [0..$offset] )
     #set( $SwiNum = $Switch + 1 )
     interface range gi ${SwiNum}/0/1 - 9, gi ${SwiNum}/0/12 - $PortTotal[$Switch]
       #access_interface
   #end
   !
   ##Uplink Port Configuration
   interface portchannel 1
    #uplink_interface
   !
```
In the above code we apply the various previously defined Macros to configure the various access ports via a loop structure. We then apply the VLANs to the port-channel.

### ***Modify Code***
Now while this is an eligant script it could be more automated and include ways to deal with both Access Points, and IOT devices in the same script. Lets look at how we might make these kind of changes in an automated programatic way.

First lests deal with vlans on the Target switch. In the example above we use one variable to extrapolate the various device VLANs. Alternatively, that could be accomplished using a built in variable like the native VLAN and a similar approach.

```
   #set( $Integer = 0 ) ##defines Integer as numeric variable
   #set( $native_bind = $native_vlan) ) ##bind variable to native vlan
   #set( $mgmt_vlan = $Integer.parseInt($native_bind) ) 
   #set( $data_offset = 100 ) ##to set the voice vlan
   #set( $voice_offset = 200 ) ##to set the voice vlan
   #set( $ap_offset = 300 ) ##to set the ap vlan
   #set( $guest_offset = 400 ) ##to set the voice vlan
   #set( $data_vlan_number = $data_offset + $mgmt_vlan )
   #set( $voice_vlan_number = $voice_offset + $mgmt_vlan )
   #set( $ap_vlan_number = $ap_offset + $mgmt_vlan )
   #set( $guest_vlan_number = $guest_offset + $mgmt_vlan )
   #set( $bh_vlan_number = 999 )
```
In this example we now no longer need to input any information and as the offsets are used if needs be we can use excel instead of set values for defining those in bulk. In the example shown we are defining them explicitly, but those lines could be replaced by entry values in a form or excel.

Secondly we could allow for various device types of Access Point and IOT device with the introduction of more Macros. As each device type may each require differing VLANs and port settings: *(note: in the guest example below the assumption is a layer 2 to a firewall providing local gateway for guest access DIA to the internet)*

```
   ##Macros
   ## Use Bind to Source variable to select access interfaces 
   #macro( access_interface )
     description Workstation
     switchport access vlan ${data_vlan_number}
     switchport mode access
     switchport voice vlan ${voice_vlan_number}
     switchport port-security maximum 3
     switchport port-security
     spanning-tree portfast
     spanning-tree bpduguard enable
   #end
   !
   #macro( access_point )
     description Access Point 
     switchport access vlan ${ap_vlan_number}
     switchport mode access
     switchport port-security maximum 3
     switchport port-security
     spanning-tree portfast
     spanning-tree bpduguard enable
   #end
   !
   #macro( guest_interface )
     description Guest Interface
     switchport access vlan ${guest_vlan_number}
     switchport mode access
     switchport port-security maximum 3
     switchport port-security
     spanning-tree portfast
     spanning-tree bpduguard enable
   #end
   !
```
The last piece of the puzzle would be to programatically determine where the ports were configured for the various tasks and devices. To accomplish this we can again resort to logic. Now to start with we need to account for whether a switch is PoE capable or not so lets add some magic.

```
   ##Stack information variables
   #set( $StackPIDs = $ProductID.split(",") )
   #set( $StackMemberCount = $StackPIDs.size() )
   #set( $PortTotal = [] )
   #set( $PoECapable = [] )
   #set( $Port = [] )
   #set( $PortsAvailable = [] )
   #set( $offset = $StackMemberCount - 1 )
   #foreach( $Switch in [0..$offset] )
     #set( $Model = $StackPIDs[$Switch])
     #if( $Model.matches(".*([U|P]).*") )
        #set( $foo = $PoECapable.add(1) )
     #else
        #set( $foo = $PoECapable.add(0) )
     #end             	
     #set( $PortCount = $Model.replaceAll("C9300L?-([2|4][4|8]).*","$1") )
     #set( $foo = $PortTotal.add($PortCount) )
     #set( $foo = $Port.add(1) )
     #set( $foo = $PortsAvailable.add($PortCount) )
   #end
```

So six lines of logic added, an *array* is created PoECapable to track switches capable of delivering PoE. Next a loop with conditional logic to set a true of false flag depending if the switch is PoE Capable again using the `.add` *method*. Lastly a Port pointer is created and set to the first port in each switch. Lastly an availability counter for the number of ports still available is set up.

The next chunk of code first resolves any accidental division by zero annomolly we might encounter by iterating through the two asked for variables for the number of Access Points and determining if they are even or odd and making them even in the later case. Additionally we need to determine how to distribute the Access Points.

```
   ##Determine how many switches we can support Access Points on
   #foreach( $PoE in $PoECapable)
      #if( $PoECapable[$Switch] == 1 )
         #set( $NoAccessPointCapableSwitch = $NoAccessPointCapableSwitch + 1 )
      #end
   #end
   !
   #set( $ModulusAccessPoints = $NoAccessPoints % $NoAccessPointCapableSwitch )
   #if( $ModulusAccessPoints != 0 )
      #set( $NoAccessPoints = $NoAccessPoints + [$NoAccessPoints % $NoAccessPointCapableSwitch] )
   #end
   !
   #set( $NoAccessPointPerSwitch = $NoAccessPoints / $NoAccessPointCapableSwitch )
   !
```

Next, we need to iterate through the switches in a logical predetermined way to set the correct macro to the port. The example might look like the following;

```
   !
   ##Start with AP distribution evenly across stack
   !
   #foreach( $Switch in [1..$StackMemberCount] )
      #if( $PoECapable[$Switch] == 1 )
         #foreach( $AccessPoint in $NoAccessPointPerSwitch )
            #if( $PortsAvailable[$Switch] != 0 )
            	interface GigabitEthernet${Switch}/0/$Port[$Switch]
                 #access_point
               #set( $PortsAvailable[$Switch] = $PortsAvailable[$Switch] - 1 )
               #set( $Port[$Switch] = $Port[$Switch] + 1 )
            #end
         #end
      #end
   #end
   !
   ##Next with Guest Interface distribution evenly across stack
   #foreach( $GuestInterfaces in $NoGuestInterfaces )
      #foreach( $Switch in [1..${StackMemberCount}] )
         #if( $PortsAvailable[$Switch] != 0 )
   		   interface GigabitEthernet${Switch}/0/$Port[$Switch]
              #guest_interface
            #set( $PortsAvailable[$Switch] = $PortsAvailable[$Switch] - 1)
            #set( $Port[$Switch] = $Port[$Switch] + 1)
   		   #break
   	   #end
      #end
   #end
   !
   ##Add Workstation ports to stack
   #foreach( $Switch in [1..${StackMemberCount}] )
      #if( $PortsAvailable[${Switch}] != 0 )
   	   interface range GigabitEthernet${Switch}/0/$Port[$Switch] - $PortTotal[$Switch]
           #Workstation
         #set( $PortsAvailable[$Switch] = 0 )
   	#end
   #end
   !
```
In the first section we iterate through the stack and for switches with PoE Capability we add an Access Point to each switch until they are evenly distributed. Next we iterate through each switch evenly distributing guest interfaces. Lastly we iterate through filling the rest of the ports with workstation interfaces.

While this is a methodology which deals programatically with port configuration and while you may adapt it for an environment, it is again lacking in the fact that its still not dynamic enough. First, its impossible to determine without looking at the configuration where something is to be plugged in and secondly if equipment or users are plugged into the wrong interface they may get the wrong level of access. 

To deal with all these outstanding issues we will look at the next lab section to provide the final solution to the problem.

## Step 4 - ***Autoconf Port Configuration - Use Case***
Previously within the Composite Templating Lab and in the previous section we introduced a methodology of automatically configuring the interfaces within the switch. This configuration relies on a few variables which were use to extrapolate the settings which were then configured via the template. This allowed for a set of macros to be utilized to build out the various settings for VLANs, Ports and Uplinks. 

While these were methodologies which dealt programatically with port configuration and while you may adapt them for an environment, they are both lacking in the fact that they are not dynamic enough. Again, its impossible to determine without looking at the configuration where something is to be plugged in and secondly if equipment or users are plugged into the wrong interface they may get the wrong level of access. 

In previous revisions of code we could deal with some of the problems with Auto Smart Port technology, but that has been depricated and its replacement is a lot more dynamic. In this section we will deal with the first part of the problem with regard to assigning ports for hardware like Access Points.

### ***Modify Code***
First lests deal with vlans on the Target switch. In the example above we modifyied the existing code to extrapolate the various device VLANs using a built in variable like the native VLAN. This is not a totally bad idea. Then you could define different native VLANs for downstream switches on a distribution thereby building out the VLANs dynamically. If you prefere and excel list of numbers that could be an alternative. In that case you would not need this section and would just rely on the variables being used after this block of code.

```
   #set( $Integer = 0 ) ##defines Integer as numeric variable
   #set( $native_bind = $native_vlan) ) ##bind variable to native vlan
   #set( $mgmt_vlan = $Integer.parseInt($native_bind) ) 
   #set( $data_offset = 100 ) ##to set the voice vlan
   #set( $voice_offset = 200 ) ##to set the voice vlan
   #set( $ap_offset = 300 ) ##to set the ap vlan
   #set( $guest_offset = 400 ) ##to set the voice vlan
   #set( $data_vlan_number = $data_offset + $mgmt_vlan )
   #set( $voice_vlan_number = $voice_offset + $mgmt_vlan )
   #set( $ap_vlan_number = $ap_offset + $mgmt_vlan )
   #set( $guest_vlan_number = $guest_offset + $mgmt_vlan )
   #set( $bh_vlan_number = 999 )
```

The next block of code sets up the VLANs and should the dynamic creation as mentioned not be desired a excel list could be used to assign them as the template is run through the UI through importing the variable settings.

```
   !
   vlan ${data_vlan_number}
    name data
   vlan ${voice_vlan_number}
    name voice
   vlan ${ap_vlan_number}
    name accesspoint
   vlan ${guest_vlan_number}
    name guest
   vlan ${bh_vlan_number}
    name disabled
   !
   device-tracking upgrade-cli force
   !
   device-tracking policy IPDT_MAX_10
    limit address-count 10
    no protocol udp
    tracking enable
   !
```
Next we need to set up the macros, but in this case we will make use of **Autoconf** and **Templates**. **Autoconf** is a solution that can be used to manage port configurations for data or voice VLAN, quality of service (QoS) parameters, storm control, and MAC-based port security on end devices that are deployed in the access layer of a network. Device classification is enabled when you enable the Autoconf feature using the autoconf enable command in global configuration mode. The device detection acts as an event trigger, which in turn applies the appropriate automatic template to the interface. When the Autoconf feature is enabled using the autoconf enable command, the default Autoconf service policy is applied to all the interfaces. For more information about **[Autoconf](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/switches/lan/catalyst9400/software/release/16-12/configuration_guide/nmgmt/b_1612_nmgmt_9400_cg/configuring_autoconf.pdf)**.

   ##Macros
   #macro( access_interface )
     description BASE CONFIG
     switchport access vlan ${bh_vlan_number}
     switchport mode access
     switchport port-security maximum 3
     switchport port-security
     snmp trap mac-notification change added
     snmp trap mac-notification change removed
     spanning-tree portfast
     spanning-tree bpduguard enable
     source template WORKSTATION
   #end
```

So the command `autoconf` enables the device classifier which can then be manipulated to stray from the builtin templates through a *parameter-map*. The parameter map command allows for mapping of defined interface templates. This is what we need to create our template for the Access Point. The rest of the builtin devices will point to the Workstation template. We define a Guest template as well as the macro for the interfaces. The macro will be used to configure the interfaces delivering with it the source template of WORKSTATION.

What this will do is configure the interface with the normal VLAN and commands listed, and then when a device is plugged in the device classifier will run. The interface will by default use the derived configuration of the WORKSTATION interface template, but should an Access Point be plugged in then the interface would defer to the ACCESS_POINT template. 

Delivering the code to the interfaces becomes simpler now because we are utilizing a more dynamic approach to device classification. 

We can continue to configure the uplink via the following Macro.
```
   !
   #macro( uplink_interface )
     switchport trunk allowed vlan add $data_vlan_number,$voice_vlan_number,$ap_vlan_number,$guest_vlan_number,$bh_vlan_number
   #end
```
Within the above code we define a Macro to add the various VLANs to the trunk interface via the Port-Channel.

As we configure the interfaces we can continue to use the previously defined method as the templates will be called and assigned more dynaically.

```
   !
   ##Access Port Configuration
   #foreach( $Switch in [0..$offset] )
     #set( $SwiNum = $Switch + 1 )
     interface range gi ${SwiNum}/0/1 - 9, gi ${SwiNum}/0/12 - $PortTotal[$Switch]
       #access_interface
   #end
   !
   ##Uplink Port Configuration
   interface portchannel 1
    #uplink_interface
   !
```
In the above code we apply the various previously defined Macros to configure the various access ports via a loop structure. We then apply the VLANs to the port-channel.

While we have configured all the various interfaces this does not take into account Authentication and Authorization scenarios. What it does though is sets us up nicely to reuse the templates calling them directly from Identity Services Engine in Authorization Policies.

## Step 5 - ***Non SDA IBNS2.0 Port Configuration - Use Case***
The last section of this lab will walk through the various considerations for **IBNS2.0** and how to deal with host onboarding in an Non **SD-Access** Fabric environment. Once the Identity Services Engine is integrated with DNA Center, then not only do you get the benefit of pxgrid integration allowing for the building of policy, but the AAA Server section within Design will build out the various settings which inturn program the network access devices for AAA Network and Client Dot1x settings.

Considering DNA Center will push at that point all the relevant IBNS2.0 settings to the device, this leaves us with the mere setting up of **Host Onboarding** which we will detail below.

#### **Important Note:** 
*We need to remember that for use of this section ISE needs to first have been integrated with DNA Center. Additionally the Design Settings will need to be modified for the sites to include at the very least **Client AAA***.

### ***Examine Code***
We will take the script as amended from above which should look like this now;

```
   #set( ${Integer} = 0 ) 
   #set( ${mgmt_vlan} = $Integer.parseInt($native_bind) ) 
   #set( ${data_offset} = 100 ) 
   #set( ${voice_offset} = 200 ) 
   #set( ${ap_offset} = 300 ) 
   #set( ${guest_offset} = 400 ) 
   #set( $data_vlan_number = $data_offset + $mgmt_vlan )
   #set( $voice_vlan_number = $voice_offset + $mgmt_vlan )
   #set( $ap_vlan_number = $ap_offset + $mgmt_vlan )
   #set( $guest_vlan_number = $guest_offset + $mgmt_vlan )
   #set( $bh_vlan_number = 999 )

```
As it stands this is not a bad place to start, and only a few additions and modifications are required to allow for IBNS2.0.

### ***Modify Code***
First we will ensure that the following lines are included to change device tracking to the modern standard

```
   device-tracking upgrade-cli force
   !
   device-tracking policy IPDT_MAX_10
    limit address-count 10
    no protocol udp
    tracking enable
```
Then we need to define the class maps which will be utilized in the Dot1x policy. The policy and class maps follow the MQC methods previously used for QoS. These have now been exploited for other service policies and now we build IBNS2.0 using the same schema.

```
   !
   class-map type control subscriber match-all DOT1X_FAILED
    match method dot1x
    match result-type method dot1x authoritative
   !
   class-map type control subscriber match-all AAA_SVR_DOWN_UNAUTHD_HOST
    match authorization-status unauthorized
    match result-type aaa-timeout
   !
   class-map type control subscriber match-all AAA_SVR_DOWN_AUTHD_HOST
    match authorization-status authorized
    match result-type aaa-timeout
   !
   class-map type control subscriber match-all DOT1X_NO_RESP
    match method dot1x
    match result-type method dot1x agent-not-found
   !
   class-map type control subscriber match-all MAB_FAILED
    match method mab
    match result-type method mab authoritative
   !
   class-map type control subscriber match-any IN_CRITICAL_AUTH_CLOSED_MODE
    match activated-service-template DefaultCriticalAuthVlan_SRV_TEMPLATE
    match activated-service-template DefaultCriticalVoice_SRV_TEMPLATE
   !
   class-map type control subscriber match-none NOT_IN_CRITICAL_AUTH_CLOSED_MODE
    match activated-service-template DefaultCriticalAuthVlan_SRV_TEMPLATE
    match activated-service-template DefaultCriticalVoice_SRV_TEMPLATE
   !
   class-map type control subscriber match-all AUTHC_SUCCESS-AUTHZ_FAIL
    match authorization-status unauthorized
    match result-type success
   !
```
As we would with MQC once we have defined the various class maps, we can then call upon them in a policy map as follows;

```
   policy-map type control subscriber PMAP_WiredDot1xClosed_Template
    event session-started match-all
     10 class always do-until-failure
      10 authenticate using dot1x retries 2 retry-time 0 priority 10
    event authentication-failure match-first
     5 class DOT1X_FAILED do-until-failure
      10 terminate dot1x
      20 authenticate using mab priority 20
     10 class AAA_SVR_DOWN_UNAUTHD_HOST do-until-failure
      30 authorize
      40 pause reauthentication
     20 class AAA_SVR_DOWN_AUTHD_HOST do-until-failure
      10 pause reauthentication
      20 authorize
     30 class DOT1X_NO_RESP do-until-failure
      10 terminate dot1x
      20 authenticate using mab priority 20
     40 class MAB_FAILED do-until-failure
      10 terminate mab
      20 authentication-restart 60
     50 class always do-until-failure
      10 terminate dot1x
      20 authenticate using mab priority 20
     60 class always do-until-failure
      10 terminate dot1x
      20 terminate mab
      30 authentication-restart 60
    event aaa-available match-all
     10 class IN_CRITICAL_AUTH_CLOSED_MODE do-until-failure
      10 clear-session
     20 class NOT_IN_CRITICAL_AUTH_CLOSED_MODE do-until-failure
      10 resume reauthentication
    event agent-found match-all
     10 class always do-until-failure
      10 terminate mab
      20 authenticate using dot1x retries 2 retry-time 0 priority 10
    event inactivity-timeout match-all
     10 class always do-until-failure
      10 clear-session
    event authentication-success match-all
    event violation match-all
     10 class always do-until-failure
      10 restrict
    event authorization-failure match-all
     10 class AUTHC_SUCCESS-AUTHZ_FAIL do-until-failure
      10 authentication-restart 60
   !
```
This policy map allows for all eventualities and gracefully flows top down in a very simple flow. It deals with all exceptions gracefully and is not as rigid as the interface configuration methodology.

Once the class maps and polcies have been defined we need to utilize them.

```
   template ACCESS_POINT
    description Access Point Interface
    switchport access vlan ${ap_vlan_number}
    switchport mode access
    dot1x pae authenticator
    dot1x timeout supp-timeout 7
    dot1x max-req 3
    mab
    access-session closed
    access-session port-control auto
    authentication periodic
    authentication timer reauthenticate server
    service-policy type control subscriber PMAP_WiredDot1xClosed_Template
   !
   template WORKSTATION
    description Workstation
    switchport access vlan ${data_vlan_number}
    switchport mode access
    switchport voice vlan ${voice_vlan_number}
    dot1x pae authenticator
    dot1x timeout supp-timeout 7
    dot1x max-req 3
    mab
    access-session closed
    access-session port-control auto
    authentication periodic
    authentication timer reauthenticate server
    service-policy type control subscriber PMAP_WiredDot1xClosed_Template
   !
```
Now that we have defined the various interface templates for use with the MQC DOT1X service policy. You have two options some prefer to call out a separate Guest interface template; however, because Dot1x technology actually automatically deals with that we will remove that template.

Next we can then modify the parameter map to suit the policy.

```
   #INTERACTIVE
   autoconf enable<IQ>yes<R>y
   #END_INTERACTIVE
   !
   parameter-map type subscriber attribute-to-service BUILTIN_DEVICE_TO_TEMPLATE
    10 map device-type regex "Cisco-IP-Phone"
     20 interface-template WORKSTATION
    20 map device-type regex "Cisco-IP-Camera"
     20 interface-template WORKSTATION
    30 map device-type regex "Cisco-DMP"
     20 interface-template WORKSTATION
    40 map oui eq "00.0f.44"
     20 interface-template WORKSTATION
    50 map oui eq "00.23.ac"
     20 interface-template WORKSTATION
    60 map device-type regex "Cisco-AIR-AP"
     20 interface-template ACCESS_POINT
    70 map device-type regex "Cisco-AIR-LAP"
     20 interface-template ACCESS_POINT
    80 map device-type regex "Cisco-TelePresence"
     20 interface-template WORKSTATION
    90 map device-type regex "Surveillance-Camera"
     10 interface-template WORKSTATION
    100 map device-type regex "Video-Conference"
     10 interface-template WORKSTATION
    110 map device-type regex "Cisco-CAT-LAP"
     10 interface-template ACCESS_POINT
   !
```
Lastly, we need to build the macro's for interface configuration, 
```
   ##Macros
   #macro( access_interface )
     description BASE CONFIG
     switchport access vlan ${bh_vlan_number}
     switchport mode access
     spanning-tree portfast
     spanning-tree bpduguard enable
     device-tracking attach-policy IPDT_MAX_10
     dot1x timeout tx-period 7
     dot1x max-reauth-req 3
     source template WORKSTATION
   #end
   !
   #macro( uplink_interface )
     switchport trunk allowed vlan add $data_vlan_number,$voice_vlan_number,$ap_vlan_number,$guest_vlan_number,$bh_vlan_number
   #end
   !
   #macro( #uplink_physical )
     access-session inherit disable autoconf
     cts manual
      policy static sgt 2 trusted     
   #end
   !
```
Then we need to configure the various interfaces with the new interface templates via macro along with modify the uplink port-channel. Additionally we need to add two CTS commands to the physical interfaces within the port-channel bundle that are not available at the logical level and only available at the physical layer.

```
   !Add SGACL enforcement
   cts role-based enforcement
   cts role-based enforcement vlan-list $data_vlan_number,$voice_vlan_number,$ap_vlan_number,$guest_vlan_number,$bh_vlan_number
   !
   ##Access Port Configuration
   #foreach( $Switch in [0..$offset] )
     #set( $SwiNum = $Switch + 1 )
     interface range gi ${SwiNum}/0/1 - 9, gi ${SwiNum}/0/12 - $PortTotal[$Switch]
       #access_interface
   #end
   !
   ##Uplink Port Configuration
   interface portchannel 1
    #uplink_interface
   !
   ##Uplink Physical Port Configuration
   interface range gi 1/0/10 - 11
    #uplink_physical
   !
```
Now that we have defined all the various IBNS2.0 configuration on the switch as a device comes up on an interface the device classifier will automatically run logically attaching the interface template configuration of WORKSTATION onto an access port. If an Access Point is classified as being attached to the interface it will instead logically attach the interface template configuration of ACCESS_POINT. Within both those interface templates the DOT1X service policy will run and the device will be authenticated, and Identity Services Engine may at that point send a Change of Authorization and put the device in a differing VLAN or more.

## Summary
Congratulations, at this point you have successfully reviewed and may have adopted the various use cases or parts of them.

The next set of labs will be to build on these concepts utilizing REST-API to push changes to DNA Center Templates and further automate the configuration in the network infrastructure.
